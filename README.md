# ANN-Mars-Terrain-Segmentation
In this assignment we received 64x128 grayscale real images from Mars terrain. Pixels in these images are categorized into five classes, each representing a particular type of terrain. This is a semantic segmentation problem, our goal is to assign the correct class label to each mask pixel.
